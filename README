This is not useful, yet. But maybe someday it will be.

It basically follows Jeff McCune's (hi Jeff!) instructions:
 http://projects.puppetlabs.com/projects/puppet/wiki/Multiple_Certificate_Authorities 

this hackish script will slowly evolve to being something useful. I am prediting that I will have to set up Chained-Certs for customers at some point in the future.

It does the following:

  - create a self-signed root signing ca cert
  - creates two cas chainged from the root cert
  - creates two signed certitficates for puppetmasters using the chained certs.
